// Read about these ->  

1) Explore the underlining Data Structures of different collections.
2) read more about max,min,closure -> done
3) SpaceShip Operator(<=>) -> 
    for a<=> b , return 1 if a>b , 0 if a=b and -1 if b>a
4) spread operator (used a lot in previous versions but now , . and *. has the same functionality)
5) equals and == :->
    diff in groovy as compared to java , the == operator is used to see if two objects are the same
    and equals is not there at all , we use is() in groovy which tells us if the objects are having the same refernce.
6) groupby :->


7) collect vs each  :-> collect creates new list, each does not



=> TOkenizer vs split
- tokenizer returns list , split returns string
- tokenizer ignores empty list , split does not.
- tokenizer cannot use regex as delimiter, split can.
